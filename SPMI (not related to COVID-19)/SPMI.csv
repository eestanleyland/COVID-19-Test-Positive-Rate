2) I'm not sure how relevant the past intern videos are. This app seems more recruiting focused - I feel like the intern videos in field would be helpful in preparation for the summer and not so much during recruiting. It may be helpful to have past advice from successful applicants instead.

For example, entering interview questions sounds like a great idea, but we're already doing that on JPAY. Considering that a lot of students don't even enter questions on JPAY, I suggest making sure questions are entered only on one platform to increase amount of responses in one place.
2) With respect to interview questions, I think students should be mandated to enter their interview questions from interviews obtained from on-campus sources on JPAY. I realize this may sound like overreach, but the more questions answered, the better students can prepare and knock the interview out of the park. Also, I think this can help us gain a competitive advantage against our peer schools by having an internal repository of interview questions.
3) Don't charge for the app. Students are already paying an exorbitant amount for an MBA--I could give you a long list of where I think Johnson could cut costs and use those savings to pay for the app.",domestic,Male,,Legal,,Finance,,13.066666666666666
